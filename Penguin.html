<p>Penguin</p>
<p>Often the protagonist of the films and games. Penguin is innocent and sweet. Has a heart of gold and possesses strength and courage, but he doesn't seem to realize what he has. Is not the smartest of all of the animals. But when the going gets tough, Penguin is sure to deliver. Likes to write his own rap songs. </p>
