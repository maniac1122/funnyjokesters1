    <p>Blog entry today: 1/9/22</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Today was a really bad day. It started with talking to that tranny guy. He was really bad. My counter-strike matches were bad, my Fortnite matches were boring. Teammates spoke spanish. Arma is too old of a game. People outside were mean, generally speaking. I'm in the New World Order. I am low, but not the lowest. Hopefully I find something else to do with my time that is enjoyable and can make some extra money. </p>
